A REST API built with Java using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL follows a monolithic architecture with a focus on microservices. It is structured with separation by layers, adhering to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

In this architecture:

- Spring Boot provides a lightweight framework for building and deploying Java-based applications quickly and efficiently.
- Spring Data JPA simplifies the implementation of data access layer by providing a set of abstractions and APIs for working with relational databases.
- MySQL is used as the database engine to store and manage data.
- Monolithic architecture means that the entire application is deployed as a single unit, rather than being divided into separate microservices.
- Separation by layers involves organizing the application into distinct layers such as the presentation layer (controllers), service layer (business logic), and data access layer (repositories).
- MVC pattern separates the application into three main components: the model (data representation), the view (presentation layer), and the controller (handles user input and interaction).
- This setup allows for the development of robust and scalable RESTful APIs in Java, leveraging the features and capabilities provided by the Spring framework.
